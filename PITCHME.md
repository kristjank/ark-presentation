[Marketplace is live!](https://marketplace.arkaces.com/)

#### SERVICES

ACES Services create and execute Service Contracts, which can be anything from uploading a file to
a storage blockchain, performing value transfers, creating smart contracts, executing code on
blockchain based computing platforms, or interacting with IoT hardware.

Example services:
- ARK->ETH channel service: https://github.com/ark-aces/aces-ark-ethereum-channel-service
- ETH->ARK channel service: https://github.com/ark-aces/aces-ethereum-ark-channel-service
- ARK->ETH contract service: https://github.com/ark-aces/aces-ark-ethereum-contract-service

---

#### LISTENERS

The ACES Listener API provides a way for all the different blockchain transaction events to be
easily consumed via a common REST-FUL API.

Docs: https://ark-aces.github.io/aces-listener-docs/

Example listeners:
- BTC listener: https://github.com/ark-aces/aces-listener-bitcoin
- ARK listener: https://github.com/ark-aces/aces-listener-ark
- ETH listener: https://github.com/ark-aces/aces-listener-ethereum

---

### WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH ACES?

- Make transaction on any* chain without holding its coin
- Deploy ETH contracts without holding ETH
- Execute functions on ETH without holding ETH
- Run an ICO

*Currently there are services for ARK~ETH, ARK~BTC, ARK~PRS, ARK A~ARK B
